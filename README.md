### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to design an accessible, USSD-based system that encourages users to participate in various faith-based challenges, quizzes, and community events. By using gamification, we make the experience more engaging, fostering an active user base that stays connected through friendly competition, spiritual growth, and community service.

### Core Features

Each feature is structured to include:
- **Concept**: The core idea or purpose of the feature.
- **Gamification Elements**: Strategies to engage users, such as points, levels, and badges.
- **Rewards**: Incentives to encourage participation and consistency.

      - Leaderboards display top scorers to inspire friendly competition.
      - Special themes, like "Miracles of Jesus" or "Proverbs of Wisdom," change weekly to keep content fresh.
   - **Rewards**: Prizes could include vouchers, church merchandise, or public recognition during services.

#### 2. Scripture Memorization Challenge
   - **Concept**: Weekly Bible verses are shared via USSD for users to memorize.
   - **Gamification Elements**:
      - Track usersâ€™ memorization progress with a weekly check-in.
      - Introduce levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced) to match varying user skill.
   - **Rewards**: Certificates, digital badges for social media, or recognition at church.

#### 3. Community Service Missions
   - **Concept**: Encourage volunteerism by listing and managing service opportunities through USSD.
   - **Gamification Elements**:
      - Users earn points for hours served; extra points for special or high-impact projects.
      - Users achieve "missionary rank" based on accumulated hours and participation.
   - **Rewards**: Special mentions in church publications, invitations to exclusive events, or recognition from church leaders.

#### 4. Daily Devotional Challenges
   - **Concept**: Daily devotionals are delivered through USSD, prompting users to reflect and share insights.
   - **Gamification Elements**:
      - Points for daily check-ins and insights shared.
      - Users can view others' reflections to create a community of shared spiritual growth.
   - **Rewards**: Monthly prize draws for participants, such as books or event passes.
